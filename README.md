# Hotel_Analysis
We are trying to find out **why both hotels are having cancellations** and how to prevent them. We also want to provide a better customer overview to achieve greater **customer satisfaction**.

## Introduction

This data comes from an open hotel booking demand dataset from [Antonio, Almeida and Nunes' article: _Hotel Booking Demand Datasets_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191#f0010)
We want the hotel to improve its profit by being able to predict future cancellations and being able to improve customer satisfaction.

__Booking Cancellations__: What variables can we make analyze to better understand cancellations and how to prevent them in the future.
We will answer the following questions during our analysis:

* Which variables affect cancellations the most?
* Which hotel has a higher count of cancellations? 
* Do certain countries have higher cancellation rates than others?
* Which seasons or months tend to have the highest number of cancellations?
* Does market segment, customer type and meal affect cancellations?
* How does the pricing differ per type? How does lead time affect correlation?

__Customer Overview:__

* Which hotel is most popular?
* Where are the majority of customers coming from?
* What strong connection is there to returning customers?
