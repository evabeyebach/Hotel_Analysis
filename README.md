# Hotel_Analysis
We are trying to find out **why both hotels are having cancellations** and how to prevent them. We also want to provide a better customer overview to achieve greater **customer satisfaction**.

## Introduction

This data comes from an open hotel booking demand dataset from [Antonio, Almeida and Nunes' article: _Hotel Booking Demand Datasets_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191#f0010)
We want the hotel to improve its profit by being able to predict future cancellations and being able to improve customer satisfaction.
